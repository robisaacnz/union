# About the Union project

Union is the sequel to [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI). A custom launcher with a consistent, simple UI across all supported emulators and devices from the same SD card. Share your library and save data (but not save states) with a handful of devices. Trimui on the bus. RG350M on the couch. I don't know, seems cool to me.

The currently in development platforms are the Trimui Model S/A66 (where MinUI was born), stock OpenDingux on the RG350/280 family of devices, and the Miyoo Mini.

### Initial planned emulator support

Emulators may be omitted from a platform depending on performance or display resolution. Additional emulators may be added in the future, time permitting.

- Pok√©mon mini
- Game Boy/Game Boy Color
- Game Boy Advance
- Nintendo Entertainment System
- Super Nintendo
- PlayStation

### Device support

Requirements for consideration:

1. firmware must live on either NAND (eg. Trimui or Miyoo Mini) or a separate SD card (eg. the 350/280 family)
2. display must be 320x240 or 640x480
3. device must have a dedicated menu button (eg. Trimui or Miyoo Mini) or free button that can be repurposed (eg. the power button or L3/R3 on the RG350/280 family)
4. firmware must support FAT32
