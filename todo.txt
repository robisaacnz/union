NOTE: platform is still determined at compile time, only SDCARD_PATH, SCREEN_WIDTH, and SCREEN_HEIGHT are really determined at runtime!

- tweak text alignment per platform
- update toolchains to use PLATFORM_OD instead of PLATFORM_RG350?
- figure out how to handle supporting multiple resolutions on the same platform in emulators
	- retroarch is getting more and more appealing...port picoarch?


- separate platform and resolution:
	determine platforms by checking for the presence of known folders or files or the contents of files?
		Trimui
			folder: /usr/trimui
		Miyoo Mini
			folder: /customer (speculation)
		OpenDingux
			file: /proc/version
				match: -dingux+ (stock)
				match: -opendingux (beta)
	determine resolution by parsing fb0/modes?
		/sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes
			U:<width>x<height>p-<number>

- add Trimui's SDL
- package up Trimui's toolchain folder and upload it to github for safekeeping?
	- maybe do for all union toolchains?
- build an SD card image
- create the Union.sh launch installer
	- Trimui doesn't need one, it has .tmp_update on SD
	- RG300 has /home/retrofw
	- I think RS-90 (and regular odbeta?) can use /etc/hostname?
	- stock od by process of elimination?
- create union forks of each emulator and apply my changes
- remove Resume from main menu (should only apply to games)
- make Union/MinUI logo a toggle?
- add RGB10 Max support (854x480)
	same vertical alignments as 640x480
	just make sure edge pinning is setup correctly for horizontal alignments

- drop RS-90 support?
	- yes, 300 or mini will replace that form factor
- drop retrofw/RG300 support?
	- yes, seems to be in a state of unstable upheaval
