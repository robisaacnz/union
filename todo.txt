- create union forks of Commander for each platform and put in Tools
	retrofw + rg350 + odbeta + rs90 https://github.com/od-contrib/commander
	trimui https://github.com/shauninman/DinguxCommander
	
- build an SD card image
- create the Union.sh launch installer
	- Trimui doesn't need one, it has .tmp_update on SD
	- RG300 has /home/retrofw
	- I think RS-90 (and regular odbeta?) can use /etc/hostname?
	- stock od by process of elimination?
- create union forks of each emulator and apply my changes
