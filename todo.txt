- union-commander
	- hook up PLATFORM into Makefile
	- rename GCW0 to RG350
	- add RetroFW
	- add RS90? (or not, it's looking more and more likely I'm not going to support this)	
- build an SD card image
- create the Union.sh launch installer
	- Trimui doesn't need one, it has .tmp_update on SD
	- RG300 has /home/retrofw
	- I think RS-90 (and regular odbeta?) can use /etc/hostname?
	- stock od by process of elimination?
- create union forks of each emulator and apply my changes
