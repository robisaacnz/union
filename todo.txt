- shell script to copy updated builds to SD card

NOTE: new SD is incompatible with old SD auto launcher on stock dingux because of system path changes

NOTE: platform is still determined at compile time, only SDCARD_PATH, SCREEN_WIDTH, and SCREEN_HEIGHT are really determined at runtime!

- figure out how to handle supporting multiple resolutions on the same platform in emulators
	- retroarch is getting more and more appealing...port picoarch?
	
	- in gambatte on odbeta I split out scaler into separate dmg and gbc scalers
		- port back to rg350? yes, well, no. not a port, stock and odbeta should share the same source
	- another wrinkle: scalers by resolution
		- 640x480 has more interesting options available than 320x240
		- maybe just separate preferences by resolution?
	- another wrinkle: previews when sharing between a 1x and 2x device on the same platform...
		- flag a platform for having multiple resolutions and save the preview at both sizes? eg. 320x240 and 160x120?
	- in gambatte the weird resolutions + IPU scaling cause mmenu issues on 640x480 screens (not an issue at 320x240)
		- limit options by resolution, don't use IPU
		- 1x, 2x, 3x, 3x
- tweak text alignment per platform
- update toolchains to use PLATFORM_OD instead of PLATFORM_RG350?

- BUG: settings changes aren't being saved on the RG350M (or is it stockod as a whole? maybe rg350 was in a hardcoded path in settings?)

- add Trimui's SDL
- package up Trimui's toolchain folder and upload it to github for safekeeping?
	- maybe do for all union toolchains?
- build an SD card image
- create the Union.sh launch installer
	- Trimui doesn't need one, it has .tmp_update on SD
	- RG300 has /home/retrofw
	- I think RS-90 (and regular odbeta?) can use /etc/hostname?
	- stock od by process of elimination?
- create union forks of each emulator and apply my changes
	- can't fork my own repos
- make Union/MinUI logo a toggle?
- add RGB10 Max support (854x480)
	same vertical alignments as 640x480
	just make sure edge pinning is setup correctly for horizontal alignments

- force nearest neighbor on od stock/beta?
	- see https://git.libretro.com/libretro/RetroArch/-/blob/master/dingux/dingux_utils.c
	- set to 0 for nn
		stock: 	/sys/devices/platform/jz-lcd.0/sharpness_upscaling
		beta:	SDL_VIDEO_KMSDRM_SCALING_SHARPNESS

- revisit .gitignore

- drop RS-90 support?
	- yes, 300 or mini will replace that form factor
- drop retrofw/RG300 support?
	- yes, seems to be in a state of unstable upheaval
