- union-commander
	- retrofw version is blurry (because of 320x480 screen?)
	- enable cursor movement in file edit?
	- there were lots of commits before this: https://github.com/od-contrib/commander/commit/5eb1ae677df5936681e20a1c2ace8aecf9a97fad
- build an SD card image
- create the Union.sh launch installer
	- Trimui doesn't need one, it has .tmp_update on SD
	- RG300 has /home/retrofw
	- I think RS-90 (and regular odbeta?) can use /etc/hostname?
	- stock od by process of elimination?
- create union forks of each emulator and apply my changes
