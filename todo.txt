- separate platform and resolution:
	determine platforms by checking for the presence of known folders or files or the contents of files?
		Trimui
			folder: /usr/trimui
		Miyoo Mini
			folder: /customer (speculation)
		OpenDingux
			file: /proc/version
				match: -dingux+ (stock)
				match: -opendingux (beta)
	determine resolution by parsing fb0/modes?
		/sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes
			U:<width>x<height>p-<number>

- add Trimui's SDL
- package up Trimui's toolchain folder and upload it to github for safekeeping?
	- maybe do for all union toolchains?
- build an SD card image
- create the Union.sh launch installer
	- Trimui doesn't need one, it has .tmp_update on SD
	- RG300 has /home/retrofw
	- I think RS-90 (and regular odbeta?) can use /etc/hostname?
	- stock od by process of elimination?
- create union forks of each emulator and apply my changes

- drop RS-90 support?
- drop retrofw/RG300 support?
	- seems to be in a state of unstable upheaval
