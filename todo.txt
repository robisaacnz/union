NOTE: platform is still determined at compile time, only SDCARD_PATH, SCREEN_WIDTH, and SCREEN_HEIGHT are really determined at runtime!

- tweak text alignment per platform
- update toolchains to use PLATFORM_OD instead of PLATFORM_RG350?
- figure out how to handle supporting multiple resolutions on the same platform in emulators
	- retroarch is getting more and more appealing...port picoarch?


- add Trimui's SDL
- package up Trimui's toolchain folder and upload it to github for safekeeping?
	- maybe do for all union toolchains?
- build an SD card image
- create the Union.sh launch installer
	- Trimui doesn't need one, it has .tmp_update on SD
	- RG300 has /home/retrofw
	- I think RS-90 (and regular odbeta?) can use /etc/hostname?
	- stock od by process of elimination?
- create union forks of each emulator and apply my changes
	- can't fork my own repos
- make Union/MinUI logo a toggle?
- add RGB10 Max support (854x480)
	same vertical alignments as 640x480
	just make sure edge pinning is setup correctly for horizontal alignments

- force nearest neighbor on od stock/beta
	- see https://git.libretro.com/libretro/RetroArch/-/blob/master/dingux/dingux_utils.c
	- set to 0 for nn
		stock: 	/sys/devices/platform/jz-lcd.0/sharpness_upscaling
		beta:	SDL_VIDEO_KMSDRM_SCALING_SHARPNESS

- revisit .gitignore

- drop RS-90 support?
	- yes, 300 or mini will replace that form factor
- drop retrofw/RG300 support?
	- yes, seems to be in a state of unstable upheaval
